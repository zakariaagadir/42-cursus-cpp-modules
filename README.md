# 42 C++ Modules (00–05)

This repository contains my solutions and learning notes for the **C++ Modules 00–05** from the **42 Cursus**.  
These modules provide a progressive introduction to the C++ programming language, focusing on object-oriented programming (OOP), memory management, and the principles of clean software design.

## 🧩 Overview of Modules

### **Module 00 – Basics of C++**
- Introduction to the C++ syntax and structure.
- Differences between C and C++.
- Understanding classes, member functions, and the concept of encapsulation.
- Implementation of simple classes like `PhoneBook` and `Contact`.

### **Module 01 – Memory Allocation & References**
- Stack vs Heap memory.
- Introduction to pointers and references.
- Dynamic allocation with `new` and `delete`.
- Understanding object lifetime and initialization lists.

### **Module 02 – Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operator Overloading, Canonical Form**
- Operator overloading (`+`, `=`, `<<`, etc.).
- Orthodox Canonical Form (default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment, destructor).
- Introduction to fixed-point numbers and class behavior consistency.

### **Module 03 – Inheritance**
- Understanding base and derived classes.
- Using inheritance to reuse and extend functionality.
- Virtual functions and polymorphism basics.
- Practice with exercises like `ClapTrap` and its derived classes.

### **Module 04 – Polymorphism & Abstract Classes**
- Deep dive into polymorphism using abstract classes and interfaces.
- Virtual destructors and the importance of `virtual` keyword.
- Concepts of upcasting and downcasting.
- Practical exercises with `Animal`, `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Brain` classes to handle deep copies.

### **Module 05 – Exceptions & Bureaucracy**
- Introduction to C++ exceptions (`try`, `catch`, `throw`).
- Exception safety and error handling best practices.
- Use of nested classes and multiple file organization.
- Implementation of a bureaucracy simulation with forms and bureaucrats.

## ⚙️ Compilation & Usage

Each module contains its own Makefile.  
To compile and run:
```bash
make
./a.out
